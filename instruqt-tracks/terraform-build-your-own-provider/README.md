# terraform-build-your-own-provider

## TODO

- create a new image for this so the setup on the first stage doesn't take as long
- update the challenge times / difficulty
- review all scripts and make sure the comments are standardized
- parameterize the file paths in the fail-messages?
- Need to make sure everything works properly w/ setup (and maybe teardown) scripts
- Going from challenge 1 toterraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve 2 caused the project to be deleted?
- Remove the terraform lock file w/ the install Make directive?
- Check the test suite runs successfully
