# terraform-build-your-own-provider

## TODO

- Create a new image for the project so the setup on the first challenge doesn't take so long
    - Golang and Docker Compose especially
- Remove the terraform lock file w/ the install Make directive?
- Define all the file path env vars in the first setup and add them to the bashrc file
- Use the actual hashicorp version of hashicups instead of my version (git clone --branch boilerplate https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-hashicups)
- Check the test suite runs successfully
