# terraform-build-your-own-provider

## TODO

- create a new image for this so the setup on the first stage doesn't take as long
- Remove the terraform lock file w/ the install Make directive?
- Check the test suite runs successfully
- Can I set env vars in setup that can be used in every subsequent script?
