# terraform-build-your-own-provider

## TODO

- New image for the project with baked in deps (Golang and Docker COmpose)
- Remove the terraform lock file w/ the install Make directive?
- Use the actual hashicorp version of hashicups instead of my version (git clone --branch boilerplate https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-hashicups)
- Check the test suite runs successfully
- `last_updated` is being set to `tostring` not the actual timestamp
