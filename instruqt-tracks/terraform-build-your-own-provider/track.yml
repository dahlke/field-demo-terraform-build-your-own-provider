    [`vault login`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/login/) command,
    or using the token in the UI.

      You are a DevOps engineer at HashiCups.
      In these tutorials, you will write a custom provider against the API of a fictional coffee-shop application called
      HashiCups using the Terraform Plugin SDKv2. Through the process, you will learn how to create data sources,
      authenticate the provider to the HashiCups client, and create resources with CRUD functionality.
