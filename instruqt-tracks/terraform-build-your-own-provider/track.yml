  assignment: |-
    The Terraform HashiCups Provider repository has been cloned for you. It will serve as the boilerplate for your
    provider workspace. Change into the cloned repository.

    ```
    cd terraform-provider-hashicups
    ```

    The HashiCups provider requires an instance of HashiCups. Navigate to the `docker_compose` directory then run
    `docker-compose` up to spin up a local instance of HashiCups on port `:19090`.

    ```
    cd docker_compose && docker-compose up
    ```

      In these tutorials, you will write a custom provider against the API of a fictional coffee-shop application called
      HashiCups using the Terraform Plugin SDKv2. Through the process, you will learn how to create data sources,
      authenticate the provider to the HashiCups client, and create resources with CRUD functionality.
